my_prompt = """
Certainly! Here's a prompt you can use for the ChatGPT API to accept Solidity smart contract code and a whitepaper, then analyze and provide insights based on your desired points:

---

**Prompt for Smart Contract and Whitepaper Analysis:**

---

**Input:**
You will receive the following two inputs:
1. **Solidity Smart Contract Code**: {}
2. **Whitepaper (Optional)**: {}

---

**Instructions for ChatGPT API:**

Using the provided smart contract code and any accompanying whitepaper or documentation, perform the following analyses:

### 1. **Tokenomics / Distribution Analysis**
- **Objective**: Analyze the tokenomics and distribution mechanisms described in the smart contract code and whitepaper (if provided).
- **Tasks**:
  - Assess the fairness of the token distribution.
  - Identify any mechanisms that could indicate potential for "rug pulls" or unfair token allocations.
  - Evaluate whether the contract has centralized control over the token minting or distribution process.
  - Highlight any risks related to the allocation of tokens that could allow project founders or insiders to control or manipulate the token supply.

### 2. **Smart Contract Functionality**
- **Objective**: Provide a breakdown of the smart contract code, explaining all the relevant functionality.
- **Tasks**:
  - Summarize the purpose of each function and its role in the overall contract.
  - Identify key components, such as minting, burning, transferring, and any access control functions.
  - Provide a clear explanation of any significant logic related to token transfers, user roles, and restrictions.

### 3. **Project Summary**
- **Objective**: Analyze the whitepaper and any other available project documentation.
- **Tasks**:
  - Provide a comprehensive and easy-to-digest project summary based on the available documents.
  - Explain the project's objectives, use cases, and overall goals.
  - Identify any key aspects of the project that align with best practices, as well as any potential concerns raised in the whitepaper.

### 4. **Vulnerabilities**
- **Objective**: Analyze the smart contract code for vulnerabilities and security risks.
- **Tasks**:
  - Scan the contract for known security vulnerabilities such as:
    - **Reentrancy attacks**
    - **Overflow/underflow errors**
    - **Improper access controls**
    - **Unchecked call exceptions**
  - Identify any other weaknesses that may compromise the security of the contract or users interacting with it.

### 5. **Red Flags**
- **Objective**: Detect suspicious patterns or behavior within the contract code that could be indicative of malicious intent or potential risks.
- **Tasks**:
  - Look for **overly complex or obfuscated code** that may hide malicious behavior.
  - Identify **backdoors** or secret functions that grant developers excessive control or allow for privileged actions.
  - Check for patterns that are often seen in **malicious projects**, such as too much control retained by developers, emergency pause functions, or administrative privileges that could be exploited.

### 6. **Risk Scoring**
- **Objective**: Generate a risk score for the smart contract and project as a whole based on the analysis.
- **Tasks**:
  - Based on the severity of identified vulnerabilities, tokenomics concerns, red flags, and overall smart contract design, provide a risk score for the project.
  - The score should range from **1 (low risk)** to **10 (high risk)**, indicating the overall level of security and fairness of the contract and project.

---

**Output:**

Please provide the following in a well-structured and easy-to-read format:

1. **Tokenomics / Distribution Analysis**
2. **Smart Contract Functionality Breakdown**
3. **Project Summary**
4. **Vulnerability Scan Report**
5. **Red Flags Detected**
6. **Risk Scoring**
